    <p>It felt like negative twenty outside today. +++</p>
<p>It feels wrong though, that the sun can shine so brightly without imparting so much as a lick of heat to warm my body.
The first steps outside seem to immediate flash freeze my muscles and bones, and zap the joy out of my brain.<br />
Kinda a shame honestly, it looks so beautiful outside.</p>
<p>I often think about people who do mood trackers, coloring a box for every day of the year to track how their day went.<br />
Would I enjoy doing something like that? Probably not, but I always wonder what my mental was at this time last year.<br />
Seasonal depression seems to come in a different flavor every year, sometimes it's as though I'm stuck in a cutscene, waiting for spring to arrive.<br />
Sometimes stress builds, only to overflow in a single instant, other years it's simmered but never was able to be released.</p>
<p>Ironically, I do think seasonal depression forces me to live healthier. Sun sets earlier, Friends hang out less, so you end up having to find other things to fill your time.<br />
In recent years that's been excercise. I've always noticed a renewed excitement and progression in my climbing during the winter months.<br />
Adrenaline is an addicting drug in that sense, a concoction of endorphines that cures the fatigue once the cold/darkness sets in.</p>
<p>So... I don't know, so far I akin this winter to treading water. It has required a certain constant mental stamina to maintain good mental health.<br />
The tricky part is to not become complacent, succumbing to fatigue is a downward spiral that is hard to break.
Maintain good routine, keep excercising, have genuine conversations with others. This is my trinity for now.</p>
