+++ title = "Fall Weather" date = 2025-10-21 +++

Fall is in full swing in the area that I live. The air is brisk and the leaves are making there way to the ground. +++

It is at this point that I start to reflect on the year and all that has happened. Perhaps I am reflecting too soon, but the weather compels me. 
With the turn of the season there comes a shift, mornings feel warmer, nights seem darker. I mean this literally as well as figuratively. 

So too does the wearyness of summer fade away, the blistering bright sun with it's heat and exhaustion that I once felt is now replaced by dimly lit streetlamps that line the pavement. 
The wind carries a different tone as though it comes from a place not from here, as if it is the culprit behind the change. 

I do not miss the long summer days, I do not look forward to the long winter nights. For the time being I can find solace in the cool fall afternoons.
