As a kid I never was able to watch horror films, not because my parents wouldn't let me, but because I had the unbespoke ability to conjure the most vivid dreamscapes to haunt myself. +++
As an adult I am still not able to watch horror films so I guess I haven't improved much, but I wish I could change that. There is a suductive quality to horror that you don't get anywhere else. 
The dark fantastical tales paired up with vivid scenery is captivating to watch, that feeling your heart beat against your chest as the adrenaline rises. 

Horror as a genre lends itself to some of the most creative settings. Since it targets such raw emotions you can throw a lot at the wall to see if it sticks. 
It's a genre deeply nested in tradition, of folk lore and stories pass down from individual to individual. This tradition has moved online as well. I think of the collection of works from the 
[scp foundation](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/), fully community driven, that come together to create this expanded lore.  

Horror doesn't have to be scary at all! I think some of the best works are the corny comedic juxtapositions against the horrific setting. It feels as though each month brings a new friendslop horror game to play 
with my friends. Watching as we all collectively lose our shit when someone gets killed or possessed.

So I deeply appriciate the works of Horror ethusiasts. It think my instinct to cower in fear is a merit to the artists ability to instill emotion in their works. No other type of media has had such easy access 
to play with my emotions, to conjure wild fantasies of Zombies Outbreaks, Robot invasions, and Supernatural entities.

Anyway Halloween is around the corner. Possibly why I'm in the horror mood as of late. This year I am dressing as a wizard, a magic wizard. I am very excited.
