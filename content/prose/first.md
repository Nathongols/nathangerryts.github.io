I have heard rumors about an age where the internet was free, unrurly and exceptionally human. That time has passed. 

Reluctantly we are forced each day to navagate a corporate wasteland of templated backgrounds, rounded buttons and generated layouts in an effort to drive user retention. 
The internet has optimized itself away from creativity and enjoyment into a prison of containerized cliques, each section of the internet governed by the companies that steal your data.

What happened to geocities? to myspace? Are we okay with casting away this canvas we been given to remained chained to restrictive platforms?  
Are we okay with allowing that content that we **own** be scraped and repurposed to fill companies pockets?

Personally, I am not. You may disagree. 

My first attempt at making a personal site ended 3 years ago after much struggle with a variety of javascript frameworks. I had lacked the distinction between "static" and "reactive" websites at the time, so I thought my only
option was to agonize over my 300 npm libraries all with conflicts and security concerns lol. 

So I am starting from scratch again, to carve out a new space for my own enjoyment. Claiming my own piece of virtual land. It is my hope that at some point I can host this site entirely on my own terms, on my own hardware.

It's my hope that the internet will once again become a place for the people, so I encourage you to join the indie web movement! Neocities is a wonderful alternative to Geocities if you're new to webdesign.

Happy Browsing!
